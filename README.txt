Example of project which creates a playable online multiplayer game.

The server and client code should be generalisable to other projects in the future.

It can easily and safely run on the local network and anyone on the wifi can connect.

It's a bit riskier to run a server locally and have people from the internet connect, this can be done with a fairly cheap online linux server if that is something I want to do nt he fture.
